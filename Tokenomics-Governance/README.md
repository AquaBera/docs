# AquaBera Tokenomics

AquaBera’s tokenomics are powered by a **Dynamic Full Float (DFF) model**, designed to avoid the pitfalls of low-float, high-FDV launches. By placing **all $AQUA** tokens into **protocol-owned liquidity** at launch and employing a companion token, **$poAQUA**, AquaBera seeks to create a sustainable, equitable ecosystem deeply integrated with Berachain’s Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL).

## 1. Overview

- **Two Key Tokens**  
  1. **$AQUA**  
     - Primary token deployed in liquidity at day one.  
     - Full float available in automated pools, fostering deep and stable liquidity from the start.  
  2. **$poAQUA**  
     - Protocol-owned counterpart token designed to bribe Berachain validators.  
     - Redeemable for Aegis-powered liquidity positions over time.  
     - Encourages long-term holding; those who keep $poAQUA benefit from accumulating more Aegis LP tokens.

- **Core Goals**  
  1. **Address Low Float, High FDV Issues**  
     - Traditional low-float tokens often cause unsustainable valuations and abrupt sell pressure.  
     - AquaBera’s DFF approach puts all $AQUA in liquidity pools upfront, ensuring substantial circulating supply from the outset.  
  2. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity**  
     - All $AQUA is initially under protocol control, mitigating mercenary capital.  
     - Over time, bribes and user interactions distribute liquidity incentives across the ecosystem.  
  3. **$poAQUA → Aegis LP → $HONEY**  
     - $poAQUA accumulates additional Aegis LP tokens, which gradually become more $HONEY (Berachain’s stable asset).  
     - If a holder redeems $poAQUA early, they forfeit future Aegis LP yield, which then accrues to remaining holders.

## 2. The Dynamic Full Float Model

### 2.1 Full Liquidity Deployment

**$AQUA**  

- **75 million** tokens placed into protocol-owned liquidity at launch.  
- Creates a **deep pool** of liquidity to prevent low-float price spikes or immediate dumps.

**$poAQUA**  

- **1 million** tokens, set aside to bribe validators, project partners, or dedicated participants.  
- Does **not** dilute the main $AQUA pool at TGE; it’s designed to drive long-term alignment.

### 2.2 Sustainability & Price Stability

- **Fewer Abrupt Unlocks**: Because $AQUA is fully in liquidity from day one, you don’t see sudden waves of new supply entering the market.  
- **Gradual $poAQUA Redemption**: Redeeming $poAQUA for underlying Aegis LP is incremental. This pacing mitigates typical “unlock day” sell pressure.

### 2.3 Benefits of DFF

1. **Equitable Token Distribution**: All $AQUA supply is accessible in the pool, aligning with Berachain’s ethos of proof-of-liquidity.  
2. **Long-Term Participation**: $poAQUA’s reward mechanism discourages quick exits and incentivizes bribe distribution to gauge voters or node delegators.  
3. **Transparency**: Smart contracts handle liquidity management, visible on-chain, and integrated with AquaBera’s Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM).

## 3. How $poAQUA Rewards Work

**Key Mechanic**  

- As time progresses, each $poAQUA accumulates more Aegis LP tokens.  
- These LP tokens become a larger proportion of $HONEY (Berachain’s stablecoin) over time.  
- **Early Redeemers**: If any $poAQUA holder redeems early, the portion of Aegis LP that would have gone to them gets redistributed among the remaining $poAQUA holders.  
- **Validator Perspective**: Validators collecting or bribing with $poAQUA are likely to hold it, boosting their potential future Aegis returns—and passing governance bribe incentives to delegators.

**Why This Matters**  

- **Ecosystem-Wide Liquidity**: Combining $AQUA, $poAQUA, and Aegis LP tokens fosters robust liquidity in multiple assets, including $HONEY.  
- **Strong Alignment**: Participants who believe in AquaBera’s long-term success are rewarded more than short-term flippers.

## 4. Context: Addressing Low-Float, High-FDV

- **Market Trend**: Many recent tokens launch at inflated fully diluted valuations, with minimal liquidity in circulation. This can lead to steep price volatility and heavy “unlock dumps.”  
- **AquaBera’s Response**:  
  1. **Dynamic Full Float**: All tokens are out at once, avoiding artificially low float.  
  2. **PoL Integration**: Encourages real liquidity usage, vital for Berachain’s security and usability.  
  3. **$poAQUA** as a Unique Bribe Asset: Node operators gain a valuable, yield-bearing token, decreasing the urge to sell and fostering long-term network stability.

## 5. Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) Synergy

**AquaBera + Berachain**  

- AquaBera’s directional liquidity strategies feed into Berachain’s PoL, driving robust yield for participants.  
- $poAQUA bribes motivate validators to support certain liquidity pools or project tokens.

**Validator Incentives**  

- By distributing $poAQUA to voters, validators build a reputation for profitable gauge selection.  
- This cycle leads to more $BGT delegations, more bribe revenue, and deeper liquidity across the chain.

## 6. Implications & Future Outlook

1. **Ecosystem-Wide Benefits**: Strong liquidity at launch ($AQUA), long-term bribe incentives ($poAQUA), and stable treasury infusion (Aegis LP → $HONEY).  
2. **Investor Confidence**: Minimizing manipulative spikes or dumps encourages a healthier trading environment.  
3. **Flexible Expansions**: Additional features (e.g., new pool pairs, cross-chain expansions) can layer onto the existing DFF framework.

**Risk Note**  
All crypto projects carry inherent volatility. AquaBera’s DFF model seeks to reduce typical pitfalls but does not eliminate all market risk.

## 7. Conclusion

AquaBera’s tokenomics revolve around **full float liquidity** ($AQUA) from day one and **protocol-owned** $poAQUA, powering Berachain validator bribes and sustainable yield via Aegis LP. This system addresses the widespread low-float/high-FDV dilemma, encouraging long-term alignment among validators, liquidity providers, and the entire AquaBera ecosystem.
