# Tokenomics & Governance

AquaBera’s tokenomics are powered by a **Dynamic Full Float (DFF) model**, designed to avoid the pitfalls of low-float, high-FDV launches. By placing **all $AQUA** tokens into **protocol-owned liquidity** at launch and employing a companion token, **$poAQUA**, AquaBera seeks to create a sustainable, equitable ecosystem deeply integrated with Berachain’s Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL).

***

## 1. Overview

* **Two Key Tokens**
  1. **$AQUA**
     * Primary token deployed in liquidity at day one.
     * Full float available in automated pools, fostering deep and stable liquidity from the start.
  2. **$poAQUA**
     * Protocol-owned counterpart token designed to bribe Berachain validators.
     * Redeemable for Aegis-powered liquidity positions over time.
     * Encourages long-term holding; those who keep $poAQUA benefit from accumulating more Aegis LP tokens.
* **Core Goals**
  1. **Address Low Float, High FDV Issues**
     * Traditional low-float tokens often cause unsustainable valuations and abrupt sell pressure.
     * AquaBera’s DFF approach puts all $AQUA in liquidity pools upfront, ensuring substantial circulating supply from the outset.
  2. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity**
     * All $AQUA is initially under protocol control, mitigating mercenary capital.
     * Over time, bribes and user interactions distribute liquidity incentives across the ecosystem.
  3. **$poAQUA → Aegis LP → $HONEY**
     * $poAQUA accumulates additional Aegis LP tokens, which gradually become more $HONEY (Berachain’s stable asset).
     * If a holder redeems $poAQUA early, they forfeit future Aegis LP yield, which then accrues to remaining holders.

## 2. The Dynamic Full Float Model

### 2.1 Full Liquidity Deployment

**$AQUA**

* **75 million** tokens placed into protocol-owned liquidity at launch.
* Creates a **deep pool** of liquidity to prevent low-float price spikes or immediate dumps.

**$poAQUA**

* **1 million** tokens, set aside to bribe validators, project partners, or dedicated participants.
* Does **not** dilute the main $AQUA pool at TGE; it’s designed to drive long-term alignment.

### 2.2 Sustainability & Price Stability

* **Fewer Abrupt Unlocks**: Because $AQUA is fully in liquidity from day one, you don’t see sudden waves of new supply entering the market.
* **Gradual $poAQUA Redemption**: Redeeming $poAQUA for underlying Aegis LP is incremental. This pacing mitigates typical “unlock day” sell pressure.

### 2.3 Benefits of DFF

1. **Equitable Token Distribution**: All $AQUA supply is accessible in the pool, aligning with Berachain’s ethos of proof-of-liquidity.
2. **Long-Term Participation**: $poAQUA’s reward mechanism discourages quick exits and incentivizes bribe distribution to gauge voters or node delegators.
3. **Transparency**: Smart contracts handle liquidity management, visible on-chain, and integrated with AquaBera’s Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM).

## 3. How $poAQUA Rewards Work

**Key Mechanic**

* As time progresses, each $poAQUA accumulates more Aegis LP tokens.
* These LP tokens become a larger proportion of $HONEY (Berachain’s stablecoin) over time.
* **Early Redeemers**: If any $poAQUA holder redeems early, the portion of Aegis LP that would have gone to them gets redistributed among the remaining $poAQUA holders.
* **Validator Perspective**: Validators collecting or bribing with $poAQUA are likely to hold it, boosting their potential future Aegis returns—and passing governance bribe incentives to delegators.

**Why This Matters**

* **Ecosystem-Wide Liquidity**: Combining $AQUA, $poAQUA, and Aegis LP tokens fosters robust liquidity in multiple assets, including $HONEY.
* **Strong Alignment**: Participants who believe in AquaBera’s long-term success are rewarded more than short-term flippers.

## 4. Context: Addressing Low-Float, High-FDV

* **Market Trend**: Many recent tokens launch at inflated fully diluted valuations, with minimal liquidity in circulation. This can lead to steep price volatility and heavy “unlock dumps.”
* **AquaBera’s Response**:
  1. **Dynamic Full Float**: All tokens are out at once, avoiding artificially low float.
  2. **PoL Integration**: Encourages real liquidity usage, vital for Berachain’s security and usability.
  3. **$poAQUA** as a Unique Bribe Asset: Node operators gain a valuable, yield-bearing token, decreasing the urge to sell and fostering long-term network stability.

## 5. Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) Synergy

**AquaBera + Berachain**

* AquaBera’s directional liquidity strategies feed into Berachain’s PoL, driving robust yield for participants.
* $poAQUA bribes motivate validators to support certain liquidity pools or project tokens.

**Validator Incentives**

* By distributing $poAQUA to voters, validators build a reputation for profitable gauge selection.
* This cycle leads to more $BGT delegations, more bribe revenue, and deeper liquidity across the chain.

## 6. Implications & Future Outlook

1. **Ecosystem-Wide Benefits**: Strong liquidity at launch ($AQUA), long-term bribe incentives ($poAQUA), and stable treasury infusion (Aegis LP → $HONEY).
2. **Confidence**: Minimizing manipulative spikes or dumps encourages a healthier trading environment.
3. **Flexible Expansions**: Additional features (e.g., new pool pairs, cross-chain expansions) can layer onto the existing DFF framework.

**Risk Note**\
All crypto projects carry inherent volatility. AquaBera’s DFF model seeks to reduce typical pitfalls but does not eliminate all market risk.
