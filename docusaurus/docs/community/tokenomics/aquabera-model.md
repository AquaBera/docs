# The AquaBera Tokenomics Model

[Previous sections remain unchanged]

## Smart Contract Mechanisms

The DFF model is powered by a series of interconnected smart contracts:

1. **Token Contracts**: Manage the creation, distribution, and tracking of $SIP and $JUG tokens.

2. **Pool Contracts**: Handle the liquidity pools where $SIP tokens are deployed.

3. **AquaBera Contracts**: Oversee the core functionality of the AquaBera ecosystem, including the Dynamic Full Float (DFF) distribution model.

4. **Aegis Contract**: An AquaBera partner that provides treasury diversification that builds, rather than undermines, liquidity strength.

5. **Jug Contract**: Manages the $JUG token mechanics, including redemption for hydration (liquidity).

6. **Liquidity Rewards Contracts**: Calculate and distribute liquidity rewards to $JUG holders.

Through these sophisticated smart contract mechanisms, AquaBera aims to create a balanced, sustainable, and engaging tokenomics model that can potentially benefit all participants in its ecosystem. The focus is on building long-term, sustainable liquidity that grows over time through trading fees, while providing flexibility for Beras to redeem their $JUGs for hydration as they choose. The Aegis Contract, in particular, plays a crucial role in ensuring that treasury diversification strengthens the overall liquidity of the system.
