# Gauges and Their Roles ðŸŽ¯

In BeraChain's Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) system, **gauges** play a critical role by directing liquidity and rewards. These gauges are responsible for determining how liquidity incentives are distributed across different pools and strategies within the network. By participating in gauge voting, stakeholders can influence the allocation of rewards, ensuring that liquidity flows to the most critical and profitable areas of the ecosystem. This mechanism not only maximizes returns for participants but also enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of liquidity provision on BeraChain.
