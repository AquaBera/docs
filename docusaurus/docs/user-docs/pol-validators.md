# Validators in Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)

Validators on Berachain secure the network, reach consensus, and earn rewards through gas fees and $BGT distribution. To become active, they stake $BERA tokens and, when selected to propose a block, direct $BGT rewards to chosen gauges, earning protocol-provided incentives.

### Maximizing Delegation

Initially, validators lack $BGT delegation weight, preventing $BGT distribution to gauges. Validators must prove they can select profitable gauges to build delegation. This requires balancing risk and reward, collaborating with protocols, and managing costs effectively.

### AquaBera's Role

AquaBera amplifies a protocol's fee generation, achieving 5-10X higher returns than traditional pools like Uniswap V2. By optimizing token emissions and incentivizing extractable liquidity, AquaBera reduces the cost of liquidity provision by 2-5X. Validators using AquaBera can offer superior rewards, attracting more $BGT delegation and maximizing their earnings.
