# $BGT Holders & Farmers in Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)

$BGT holders and liquidity depositors are crucial in Berachain's PoL system, guiding governance and economic incentives by delegating $BGT to validators. AquaBera enhances this by offering directional liquidity strategies that significantly outperform traditional AMM models.

### The Power of Directional Liquidity with AquaBera

Unlike status quo AMM pools, which risk over-selling assets or require active management, AquaBera’s directional liquidity approach focuses on protecting asset value while maximizing returns. And it enables depositors to earn 5-10X higher fees than traditional Uniswap V2 pools.  By optimizing liquidity strategies, AquaBera ensures that $BGT holders and depositors maximize their returns with minimal exposure to unnecessary risk. 

Delegating $BGT to validators who leverage AquaBera’s directional strategies allows for superior income generation while safeguarding asset value.
