# The AquaBera Tokenomics Model

# Introduction to AquaBera Tokenomics

AquaBera introduces an innovative tokenomics model designed to address the challenges faced by traditional token launches and recent trends in the cryptocurrency market. At the core of this model is the Dynamic Full Float (DFF) distribution, professionally designed by our partner, [Amplifi](../partners/amplifi.md).

## The Current State of Tokenomics

Recent trends in the cryptocurrency market have raised concerns about the sustainability and fairness of many token launches. As highlighted in a Binance Research article, "Low Float & High FDV: How Did We Get Here?", there's a growing prevalence of tokens with high valuations and low initial circulating supply. This trend poses several challenges:

1. **Limited Sustainable Upside**: Such market structures often leave little sustainable upside for traders after the token generation event (TGE).

2. **Future Selling Pressure**: It's estimated that approximately $155B worth of tokens will be unlocked from 2024 to 2030. Without a corresponding increase in buy-side demand, this could create significant selling pressure.

3. **Inflated Valuations**: Factors such as an influx of private market capital and upbeat market sentiment have contributed to tokens launching with high fully diluted valuations (FDVs).

4. **Inequitable Distribution**: The current market setup often results in an uneven distribution of tokens, favoring early private investors over public participants.

## AquaBera's Innovative Approach

AquaBera's Dynamic Full Float (DFF) model is designed to address these challenges head-on:

1. **Full Liquidity Deployment**: Unlike low float launches, AquaBera deploys all 75 million $SIPs to the liquidity pool from day one, ensuring deep liquidity from the start.

2. **Controlled Distribution**: While all tokens are in the pool, the $JUG system provides a controlled, fair distribution mechanism that prevents immediate dumping.

3. **Sustainable Value Creation**: The DFF model is designed to create long-term value, aligning the interests of all participants from day one.

4. **Equitable Participation**: The $JUG system allows for fair participation, giving all Beras an equal opportunity to benefit from the project's growth.

5. **Mitigated Selling Pressure**: By incentivizing long-term holding and gradually releasing liquidity, AquaBera aims to mitigate the kind of selling pressure often seen in traditional token unlocks.

## The Role of Aegis

Another key partner in AquaBera's tokenomics is [Aegis](../partners/aegis.md). Aegis plays a crucial role in treasury diversification and maintaining optimal liquidity ratios:

- Aegis is responsible for mixing the perfect amount of $HONEY, Berachain's stablecoin, into every $JUG.
- It uses an innovative dual vault strategy to steadily diversify positions while building liquidity strength.
- This approach allows for efficient management of liquidity positions, enabling AquaBera to maintain stability while still benefiting from market opportunities.

As we delve deeper into the specifics of AquaBera's tokenomics in the following sections, keep in mind how each aspect of the model is designed to address these broader market challenges and create a more sustainable, equitable ecosystem for all participants.


## Smart Contract Mechanisms

The DFF model is powered by a series of interconnected smart contracts:

1. **Token Contracts**: Manage the creation, distribution, and tracking of $SIP and $JUG tokens.

2. **Pool Contracts**: Handle the liquidity pools where $SIP tokens are deployed.

3. **AquaBera Contracts**: Oversee the core functionality of the AquaBera ecosystem, including the Dynamic Full Float (DFF) distribution model.

4. **Aegis Contract**: An AquaBera partner that provides treasury diversification that builds, rather than undermines, liquidity strength.

5. **Jug Contract**: Manages the $JUG token mechanics, including redemption for hydration (liquidity).

6. **Liquidity Rewards Contracts**: Calculate and distribute liquidity rewards to $JUG holders.

Through these sophisticated smart contract mechanisms, AquaBera aims to create a balanced, sustainable, and engaging tokenomics model that can potentially benefit all participants in its ecosystem. The focus is on building long-term, sustainable liquidity that grows over time through trading fees, while providing flexibility for Beras to redeem their $JUGs for hydration as they choose. The Aegis Contract, in particular, plays a crucial role in ensuring that treasury diversification strengthens the overall liquidity of the system.
