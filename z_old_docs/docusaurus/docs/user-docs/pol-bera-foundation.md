# Bera Foundation in Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)

The Bera Foundation operates core decentralized applications (dApps) like [BEX](https://bartio.bex.berachain.com/), [Bend](https://bartio.bend.berachain.com/), and [Berps](https://bartio.berps.berachain.com/) on Berachain, creating native demand for $BGT through the fees these dApps generate. These activities support the value of $BGT emissions and the $BERA token itself by increasing capital efficiency, reducing the cost of extractable liquidity, and attracting protocols to the Berachain ecosystem.

## Enhancing PoL with AquaBera

AquaBera introduces directional liquidity into PoL, allowing the Foundation to craft sustainable liquidity deals that make Berachain an attractive destination for protocols even before they fully launch their decentralized applications. This model enables the Foundation to be repaid through a share of trading fees, ensuring that liquidity incentives are not just effective but also sustainable.

By increasing the capital efficiency of liquidity, AquaBera drives additional revenue for liquidity providers and protocols. This, in turn, allows them to offer more incentives to validators, creating a positive feedback loop that strengthens the Berachain ecosystem.

In short, while the Foundation's dApps like BEX, BEND, and BERPS provide a solid foundation, AquaBera accelerates the growth of Berachain by driving liquidity strength to the $BERA token and enhancing the overall value of $BGT emissions.
