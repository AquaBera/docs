# Ecosystem Projects in Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)

Ecosystem projects are key to Berachain's PoL, using it to bootstrap liquidity more effectively than traditional liquidity mining.

## Leveraging AquaBera for Ecosystem Growth

AquaBera helps ecosystem projects leverage directional liquidity, attracting $BGT rewards to gauges. This directs liquidity to strengthen token value, rather than risking emissions being sold off.

### Sustainable Liquidity Deals

AquaBera’s sustainable liquidity deals attract tokens to Berachain before full dApp deployment, enhancing $BERA value and network efficiency. AquaBera makes it possible for ecosystems on Berachain, and perhaps even the [Bera Foundation itself](./pol-bera-foundation), to attract tokens and liquidity to Berachain ahead of the full deployment of operational decentralized applications.

### Increased Capital Efficiency

AquaBera’s strategies enable 5-10X more extractable liquidity and fee revenue, enriching projects and the wider Berachain ecosystem.

### Aligning with $BGT Holders and Validators

Ecosystem projects can further maximize their success by aligning their goals with $BGT holders and validators. AquaBera's platform enables protocols to create incentives that are more closely aligned with the interests of these key stakeholders, leading to a more robust and resilient liquidity pool.

In summary, AquaBera empowers ecosystem projects within the PoL system to drive growth, maximize rewards, and contribute to the overall health of the Berachain network.
