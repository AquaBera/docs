# Treasury Diversification with Aegis

[Aegis](https://aegis.markets/) is a decentralized protocol that helps crypto projects transform idle treasury assets into stable, revenue-generating positions—**without** creating unwanted sell pressure on their native tokens. On **Berachain**, Aegis relies **exclusively** on [**AquaBera**](../AutomatedLiquidityManager/README.md) for automated liquidity management, ensuring optimal use of concentrated liquidity pools.

## Why Aegis + AquaBera?

1. **Automated Liquidity Management**  
   - Aegis treasury assets are deployed into concentrated liquidity pools managed by AquaBera’s ALM (Automated Liquidity Manager).  
   - This integration avoids bulk “market sell” events, reducing token price impact.

2. **Diversification & Stability**  
   - Idle treasury tokens can be partially converted into stable or blue-chip assets, creating a sustainable revenue stream.  
   - This method relieves typical funding/sell-pressure tensions between founders and community members.

3. **Fully On-Chain & Transparent**  
   - Both Aegis and AquaBera operate on smart contracts, enabling real-time visibility for all stakeholders.  
   - DAOs and communities can audit treasury movements on the blockchain.

4. **Reduced Complexity**  
   - AquaBera’s ALM automates rebalancing, directional liquidity, and yield collection.  
   - Projects only need to select an Aegis vault, deposit assets, and monitor returns.

## Key Benefits

- **No Sell Pressure**  
  Treasury assets diversify without large open-market sales.  
- **Ongoing Fee Generation**  
  AMM trading fees flow back into the vault, potentially compounding over time.  
- **Risk Mitigation**  
  Concentrated liquidity plus stable-asset accumulation lowers exposure to single-token volatility.  
- **Seamless Integration**  
  Aegis leverages AquaBera’s proven ALM functionality for directional liquidity on Berachain.

## Basic Workflow

1. **Treasury Deposit**  
   - A project deposits a portion of its tokens (or other approved assets) into an Aegis vault.  
2. **Liquidity Deployment**  
   - Aegis (with AquaBera’s ALM) places these tokens in **concentrated liquidity pools** (e.g., Algebra/Kodiak on Berachain).  
3. **Revenue Generation**  
   - Collected trading fees accrue in the vault. Depending on the vault’s settings, these may be rebalanced automatically.  
4. **Monitor & Adjust**  
   - Treasury managers can view on-chain dashboards to see how tokens are diversifying into stable assets and track overall yield.
