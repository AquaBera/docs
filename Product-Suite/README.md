# AquaBera Product Suite

Welcome to the **AquaBera Product Suite**, a collection of DeFi solutions built around **Berachain** to optimize liquidity, power fair token launches, and enable treasury diversification. Our aim is to streamline complex decentralized finance workflows while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.

## Overview

AquaBera provides three core products:

1. **Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM)**  
   - **What It Does**: The ALM autonomously manages concentrated liquidity positions, aligning your deposit token with market movements and capturing the highest possible trading fees.  
   - **Key Benefits**:  
     - Single-sided deposits (no forced 50/50 pairing)  
     - Automatic rebalancing with reduced swap costs  
     - Enhanced capital efficiency and risk mitigation  
   - **Learn More**: [Automated Liquidity Manager](./AutomatedLiquidityManager/README.md)

2. **Launch Platform (Pot2Pump)**  
   - **What It Does**: A meme-token launchpad designed to ensure fair and transparent liquidity bootstrapping, free of bonding-curve pitfalls.  
   - **Key Benefits**:  
     - Refund mechanism if funding thresholds are not met  
     - 40% of LP tokens “technically burned” yet still earning fees  
     - Exclusive integration of AquaBera’s ALM for concentrated liquidity  
   - **Learn More**: [Pot2Pump Launch Platform](./LaunchPlatform/README.md)

3. **Treasury Diversification with Aegis**  
   - **What It Does**: Aegis converts idle treasury tokens into stable, fee-generating assets on Berachain, **exclusively** using AquaBera’s ALM for on-chain liquidity management.  
   - **Key Benefits**:  
     - Minimal sell pressure on native tokens  
     - Sustainable revenue streams in stable or blue-chip assets  
     - Transparent, on-chain treasury activity  
   - **Learn More**: [Treasury Diversification with Aegis](./TreasuryDiversificationWithAegis/README.md)

> **Note**: We currently do **not** have a standalone yield aggregator product. Any future yield aggregation or vault-based strategies will be announced in upcoming releases.
