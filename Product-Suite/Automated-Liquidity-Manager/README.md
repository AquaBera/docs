# Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM)

Welcome to AquaBera's **Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM)** documentation. The ALM is a fully on-chain system that optimizes how your liquidity is deployed across various AMMs in the Berachain ecosystem. Whether you're a project treasury, an individual liquidity provider, or a validator looking to maximize rewards, the ALM ensures your assets are always working efficiently with minimal risk.

## What is the ALM?

AquaBera's ALM is an advanced liquidity management tool that:

- **Aligns liquidity with market conditions** to avoid over-selling or under-allocating tokens.
- **Automates rebalancing** in response to price movements, volatility, and strategic objectives.
- **Preserves capital** by mitigating impermanent loss, while maximizing fee income and liquidity incentives.

## Key Features

- **Single-Token Deposits**  
  The ALM allows you to deposit just one token, automatically handling liquidity without forcing you into a 50/50 pair.

- **Directional Liquidity**  
  By prioritizing the asset you deposit, the ALM helps protect against unwanted selling or accumulation, particularly useful in volatile markets or new token launches.

- **Automated Rebalancing**  
  The ALM monitors your liquidity “inventory” and adjusts positions in real time—no manual oversight or additional gas fees required for rebalances.

- **Integration with Berachain**  
  Tightly integrated with Berachain’s Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) system and various AMMs (like Kodiak), so you can easily capture gauge incentives and BeraChain rewards.
