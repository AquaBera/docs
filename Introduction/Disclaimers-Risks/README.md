# Disclaimers & Risks

## Effective Date: January 1, 2025

This Disclaimer & Risks notice ("Disclaimer") governs your access to and use of the AquaBera decentralized finance ("DeFi") platform, protocols, user interfaces, websites, applications, smart contracts, and any related services (collectively, the "Services" or "AquaBera"). Please read this Disclaimer carefully. By accessing or using any portion of AquaBera, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein. If you do not agree, you must not access or use AquaBera.

## 1. General Information & No Advice

### 1.1 No Financial or Investment Advice

AquaBera provides access to various blockchain and DeFi functionalities, but does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice. Any information presented within AquaBera's interfaces, documentation, or communication channels is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, or other professional advice.

### 1.2 No Fiduciary Duty

Your use of the Services does not create or imply a fiduciary relationship of any kind. You alone are responsible for evaluating the risks and merits of interacting with any of the DeFi protocols, tokens, or smart contracts accessible via AquaBera.

### 1.3 Consult Professionals

You are strongly encouraged to consult with independent financial, legal, tax, or other professional advisors before making any decisions based on your personal objectives, financial situation, and risk tolerance.

## 2. Restricted Jurisdictions

### 2.1 Regulatory Limitations

AquaBera is designed to be used globally in a compliant manner. However, due to varied and evolving legal and regulatory landscapes, certain jurisdictions may prohibit or restrict the use of decentralized technologies or digital assets. You must comply with the laws and regulations of your own jurisdiction.

### 2.2 Prohibited Usage

If you are located in, incorporated in, or otherwise a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction where digital asset activities, DeFi, or similar financial instruments are restricted or illegal—including (but not limited to) the following territories—you are prohibited from using AquaBera:

- United States of America
- Countries or regions subject to comprehensive sanctions (e.g., North Korea, Iran, Syria)
- Any other jurisdiction where the use of decentralized or blockchain-based systems is prohibited or in conflict with applicable laws

### 2.3 User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for determining your eligibility to use the Services in compliance with all applicable local laws. AquaBera disclaims all liability for any violation of laws by users in restricted or prohibited jurisdictions.

## 3. Technology & Security Risks

### 3.1 Smart Contract Risks

AquaBera operates via smart contracts on the Berachain blockchain (and potentially other blockchains). Smart contracts are experimental and may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or errors that could lead to partial or total loss of digital assets. There is no guarantee that smart contracts will function as expected or intended.

### 3.2 Cryptographic & Blockchain Risks

Blockchain technologies involve inherent risks, including the possibility of protocol failures, blockchain reorganizations ("reorgs"), hacking, double-spending attacks, or other exploitation techniques. You understand and accept that your assets may lose value or become irretrievable in the event of a network or protocol-level security incident.

### 3.3 Market Risks

The value of digital assets can be extremely volatile. Prices can fluctuate significantly at any time, and past performance is not indicative of future results. You should never risk more than you can afford to lose.

### 3.4 Third-Party Integrations

AquaBera may integrate or interact with third-party protocols, projects, or platforms, such as automated market makers, lending platforms, yield optimizers, or bridging services. AquaBera is not responsible for the security, reliability, or functionality of any third-party software, tools, or services. Your use of external solutions is solely at your own risk.

## 4. No Liability & No Warranties

### 4.1 No Guarantees

The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind—express or implied—including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or accuracy.

### 4.2 Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, AquaBera, its contributors, developers, partners, or any affiliated entities shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to loss of funds, lost profits, lost data, or any financial losses arising out of or related to your access to or use of the Services.

### 4.3 Indemnification

By using AquaBera, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless AquaBera, its contributors, developers, partners, and affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your use or misuse of the Services, violation of this Disclaimer, or infringement of any third-party rights or applicable laws.

## 5. Regulatory & Compliance Disclosures

### 5.1 Evolving Regulations

Blockchain, digital asset, and DeFi regulations are rapidly evolving. Legislative or regulatory changes may adversely impact the Services or the utility of digital assets accessed via AquaBera. AquaBera does not guarantee the legality of its Services under any future legal scenario.

### 5.2 Tax Obligations

You are solely responsible for determining and complying with any applicable tax obligations arising from your use of the Services, including filing requirements, capital gains, income, or any other form of taxation.

### 5.3 No Offer of Securities

Nothing in AquaBera's documentation, interfaces, or other communications constitutes an offer or sale of securities, nor a solicitation for investment in any securities. Any tokens or other digital assets accessed via AquaBera are provided solely for technological purposes, and their value or usage may be speculative and subject to substantial risk.

## 6. Updates & Revisions

### 6.1 Changes to the Disclaimer

This Disclaimer may be amended, revised, or updated at any time. Any changes will be posted via AquaBera's official communication channels or within the same repository. Continued use of the Services after the effective date of updated terms constitutes acceptance of the revised Disclaimer.
